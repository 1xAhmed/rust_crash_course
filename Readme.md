#learnRust with me. I have created a concise, articulated, to-the-point #Rust crash course with practical examples and explanation with inline code comments.

Why I created the course?

In this day and age, when we have all the information in the world at our fingertips, we often get confused when we want to learn or explore something new. Our minds gets flooded with all the information and the content which is very overwhelming for us.

I have created this #Rust crash #course just to deal with this and give you a glimpse into Rust with concise, practical examples and explanation with inline code comments.

Why learn rust?

#Rust takes your programing skills and multiplies with atleast 5. It gives you a new perspective to do things and makes you a better developer just by building things in rust. If you donâ€™t want to code or have a career in Rust, then don't. But learning Rust will make you a far better dev and take your fundamentals and thinking to the next level with new perspectives of robust memory management, ownership, borrowing, concurrency, performance & speed.

#Like #Share and give it a star. But most importantly don't forget to give critical feedback which immensely helps me to improve myself.
